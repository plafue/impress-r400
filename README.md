impress-r400
============

Support for Logitech's Wireless Presenter R400 in impress.js presentations (altough it does not need impress.js in any way, but this is my main use case :) ).

Basically support for blacking out the screen when the (wait for it...) black screen button (aka letter "b") is pressed.
